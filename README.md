# Healthcare outcome measures exploration

Working in a hospital has given me an appreciation of the complexity of the systems at play and the diversity of interested parties. 

This complexity is reflected in the numerous outcomes measures that are used to assess the quality of healthcare facilities.

For instance, readmission rate is a crucial outcome measure because unplanned readmissions are very costly and often preventable. This outcome measure is often used by entities such as CMS to evaluate a facility. 

Another example is patient experience, as reflected in patient reported outcome measures (PRAMs) such as the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS). 

Sometimes, these outcome measures can come into conflict with each other. For instance, practices such as 
 - medication reconciliation
 - followup
